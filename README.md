# Hospital-Simulation-Project
We modeled a hospitalâ€™s patient flow and departments using a flowchart. Then, we developed a system model, determined the statistical distribution of hospital operation times, and implemented it in Python using queue theory to calculate performance metrics. Finally, we evaluated various system approaches to find the optimal design.
